# Facebook Birthdays

^
When I get an "HBD" from a FB friend, I think "okay, you cared enough to fill in the box when Facebook told you to."

Someone had to go to the store, think about which card was best, spend real money on it, write something real in it, lick that disgusting envelope glue, spend _more_ real money for a stamp, and physically take it to a post box. And they had to do all of this in advance so it would arrive on your actual birthday.

^ We taught him a few tricks, but probably the best one was the highfive.
